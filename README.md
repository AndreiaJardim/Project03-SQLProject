# Project03-SQLProject

## Project Overview:
We were hired by Ironhack to perform an analytics consulting project to understand the possibility of expanding Ironhack schools to other cities.
The project will focus on understanding the market conditions of five cities, namely Barcelona, Madrid, Berlin, Munich, and London, and use this information to determine the potential for Ironhack to expand to Munich and London.


## Objectives:

The main goal of this analysis is to determine the potential for Ironhack to expand to new cities such as Munich and London.

To achieve this we will do the following analysis:
- Evaluate the potential demand for coding education in Munich and London, based on factors such as population size and age demographics.
- Assess the market conditions (salary levels and unemployment rates) in Munich and London and compare them to those in Barcelona, Madrid, and Berlin to determine the feasibility of expanding Ironhack to these cities.
- Provide recommendations to Ironhack's management team based on the analysis of market conditions in each city and the competitive landscape of the coding school market, with the aim of identifying the most promising location for expansion.


## Methodology:
To achieve these objectives, the project will involve the following steps:
1. Get the detailed information about the data analytics coding schools;
2. Build the necessary SQL queries to construct and populate the tables, using Python connectors;
3. Collect data on the demand for coding education in Munich and London, including population demographics, salary levels, and unemployment rates;
3. Analyze the data to perform the business analysis (Jupiter notebooks - Python);
